    Need to clarify what sort of implicit casting is occurring across each layer of the app.
        sqlite3
        json.dumps
        flask (reading request.json)
        (javascript) JSON.stringify.


    Remember to restart the systemd service after pulling latest..

    Addressed the refresh problem with nginx routing. All URLs fitting /apps/sale_monitor load the index.html.
    Perhaps a better solution could be done with a redirect and the originating URL in the query string.

    NGINX note:
    
    location /service/ {
        # Note the trailing slash on the proxy_pass.
        # It tells nginx to replace /service/ with / when passing the request.
        proxy_pass http://apache/;
    }

    systemctl enable nginx: To ensure that nginx starts on boot now that we've gone through the trouble of making sure
                            our gunicorn server does.

    Python module/package import system is really testing my patience. Trying to import from a sibling directory feels i
    impossible. Create a symlink in the checker directory to Communicator and update the imports in controller.py
    'checker' must be the working directory for the script to run properly.

    pretty print dictionaries using json.dumps with and indent argument.

    cron: need to export environment variables in in wrapper scripts I guess. Also include a PATH variable in the
          crontab.

    Deploy:
        Run init.sh to install necessary python packages (assumes pipenv is already installed)
        Register and start the systemd service
        configure nginx to forward requests to the unix socket
        profit

    Systemd: user environment variables were not accessible from within the service. Needed to specify additional
             "Environment" values. The quotes around the value were taken literally so avoid those.

    Documenting NGINX stuff this time

    /etc/nginx/nginx.conf is the config file.

    We've got Lets Encrypt Certbot handling the SSL certificate.

    /etc/profile for default env vars.

    pipenv virtualenvs are stored in ~./.local/share

    Made a systemd service for the server so that everything runs at boot.
    Good resource here: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-serve-flask-applications-with-gunicorn-and-nginx-on-ubuntu-18-04#step-4-configuring-gunicorn

    Oh remember from last time, different distros have a different arrangement of nginx files.
    And similarly, different unix groups (digital ocean guide recommends www-data but is absent from Amazon Linux 2).

    sudo systemctl state <service>
    sudo systemctl restart <service>
    sudo systemctl daemon-reload

    sudo less /var/log/nginx/error.log: checks the Nginx error logs.
    sudo less /var/log/nginx/access.log: checks the Nginx access logs.
    sudo journalctl -u nginx: checks the Nginx process logs.
    sudo journalctl -u myproject: checks your Flask appâ€™s Gunicorn logs.


    Restart nginx after configuration file changes
    run daemon-reload after updating a .service file

    Can't figure out why the unix socket approach is not working.  systemd.service works just fine
    when binding to localhost:port. The trailing slash makes or breaks the API calls..

    Solved the problem: just as we needed the trailing slash in
        http://localhost:5000/
    for the proxy to work, we required the equivalent on the unix socket
        http://unix:/home/....../sale_monitor.sock:/

    smtp can only send ascii characters. Non-ascii raises an error.

    SMTP password for gmail is generated in "security -> signing in to google"

    Kroger's API is broken tonight so can't confirm but I think the alert system is operational.
    checker./controller.py is to be scheduled with cron Thursdays at noon.

    Next lift is to support multiple users of the system using the contact email as the identifier.

    GET requests aren't allowed a body? So any 'args' must be passed in the query string.
    Kroger product image sizes:
            small, medium, large, xlarge, thumbnail

    Assuming every image has each size for now.
